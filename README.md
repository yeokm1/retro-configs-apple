This is a desktop Mac released in 2003. This model is unfortunately the first one of this series that cannot boot natively into the Mac OS 9. 

If OS 9 has to be used, it can only be officially done though the Classic environment abstraction layer.

However native OS 9.2.2 booting can still be done with some workarounds.

I will install both Mac OS 9.2.2 and OS X 10.4 Tiger on this system as a dual boot configuration.
